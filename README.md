# CryptoWordMessage_in_java
CryptoWordMessage is related to cryptographic Message where the message is converted into some of the other unreadable format.
I have implemented in java programming language. It uses two codes to generate or convert the message to other unreadable message.
This converted message can alone is used to regenerate the message to the original form. To convert back to the original message the seprate key is not sent seprately but it is embedded within the Message.
